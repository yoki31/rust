//! Types with platform-specific representations.
//!
//! This module is for defining types, like `Ipv6Addr`, which have OS-specific
//! representations. It does not do any allocation, as that would belong in the
//! alloc library, and it does not perform any actual I/O, as that would belong
//! in the std library.
